## MORSE CODE

Summary: Morse code project converts text to Morse code and vice versa.
Morse code is an ancient coding mechanism to obfuscate unintended listeners. 

## Problems it solves 

Dots and dashes are called dits and dahs and each letter in the alphabet is
represented with these dits and dahs. In like manner, sentences, paragraphs and even essays can be represented with Morse code. 
This app creates different levels to test the audience's proficiency in converting texts to Morse code and vice versa.
